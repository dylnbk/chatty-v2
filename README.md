Installation
Prerequisites
Python: Ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed. You can download it from Python.org.
pip: Python package installer. It usually comes bundled with Python.
1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chatgpt-streamlit-app.git
cd chatgpt-streamlit-app

2. Install Dependencies
It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

Using venv:
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Set Up Firebase Firestore
Create a Firebase Project:

Go to the Firebase Console.
Click on "Add project" and follow the prompts to create a new project.
Enable Firestore:

In your Firebase project dashboard, navigate to Firestore Database.
Click on Create database and follow the setup instructions.
Generate Service Account Key:

Navigate to Project Settings > Service Accounts.
Click on Generate new private key and save the JSON file.
Note: You'll need the contents of this JSON file for the next step.

4. Configure st.secrets
Streamlit uses st.secrets to manage sensitive information securely. You need to set up the secrets required by the app.

Create a Secrets File:

Create a file named secrets.toml in the root directory of your project with the following structure:

[OPENAI_API_KEY]
OPENAI_API_KEY = "your-openai-api-key"

[GOOGLE_API_KEY]
GOOGLE_API_KEY = "your-google-api-key"

[ANTHROPIC_API_KEY]
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = "your-anthropic-api-key"

[textkey]
textkey = """
{
    "type": "service_account",
    "project_id": "your-project-id",
    "private_key_id": "your-private-key-id",
    "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
    "client_email": "your-client-email@your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
    "client_id": "your-client-id",
    "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
    "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
    "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
    "client_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/your-client-email@your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
}
"""

[passw]
# Optional: Uncomment and set your password if you want to enable password protection
# passw = "your-secure-password"

Replace the placeholders (your-openai-api-key, your-google-api-key, etc.) with your actual API keys and Firebase service account details.

Secure Your Secrets:

Ensure that secrets.toml is not committed to version control by adding it to your .gitignore:

# Add to .gitignore
secrets.toml

5. (Optional) Set Up Password Protection
The app includes optional password protection to restrict access.

Enable Password Protection:

In the secrets.toml file, uncomment and set the passw field:

[passw]
passw = "your-secure-password"

Usage:

If password protection is enabled, users will be prompted to enter the password in the sidebar to access the chat functionalities.

Running the App
After completing the installation and configuration steps, you can run the Streamlit app using the following command:

streamlit run app.py

Replace app.py with the filename of your Streamlit application if different.

The app should open in your default web browser. If it doesn't, navigate to the URL provided in the terminal output (usually http://localhost:8501).
