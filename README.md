# Multi AI Platform Streamlit App

This application provides a chat interface to consolidate OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic models into one chat service. It includes conversation saving/loading, file uploads, image generation, integrated with Firebase Firestore for persistent storage. Available models will depend on your API access, please check your development account with the various platforms.

## Features

- **Conversation Management**: Save, load, and delete chat conversations using Firebase Firestore.
- **File Uploads**: Upload and handle images, audio, video, PDFs, CSVs, Excel files, and plain text.
- **Image Generation**: Generate images using OpenAI's DALLÂ·E model directly from the chat interface.
- **Optional Password Protection**: Protect access to the app with a password.
- **User Information Integration**: Each user message is prepended with user information for personalized interactions.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python**
- **pip**

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dylnbk/chatty-v2.git
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Set Up Firebase Firestore

**Create a Firebase Project:**

- Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
- Click on **"Add project"** and follow the prompts to create a new project.

**Enable Firestore:**

- In your Firebase project dashboard, navigate to **Firestore Database**.
- Click on **"Create database"** and follow the setup instructions.

**Generate Service Account Key:**

- Navigate to **Project Settings > Service Accounts**.
- Click on **"Generate new private key"** and save the JSON file.
- **Note:** You'll need the contents of this JSON file for the next step.

### 4. Configure `st.secrets`

Streamlit uses `st.secrets` to manage sensitive information securely. You need to set up the secrets required by the app.

**Create a Secrets File:**

Create a `.streamlit` folder in the root directory of your project, and a file named `secrets.toml` with the following structure:

```toml
[OPENAI_API_KEY]
OPENAI_API_KEY = "your-openai-api-key"

[GOOGLE_API_KEY]
GOOGLE_API_KEY = "your-google-api-key"

[ANTHROPIC_API_KEY]
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = "your-anthropic-api-key"

[textkey]
# Use key-to-toml.py to convert your JSON to TOML and paste it here

[passw]
# Optional: Uncomment and set your password if you want to enable password protection
# passw = "your-secure-password"
```

**Replace the placeholders** (`your-openai-api-key`, `your-google-api-key`, etc.) with your actual API keys.

**Secure Your Secrets:**

Ensure that `secrets.toml` is not committed to version control by adding it to your `.gitignore`:

```gitignore
# Add to .gitignore
/.streamlit/secrets.toml
```

### 5. Config settings for Streamlit Cloud file uploads

In the `.streamlit` folder, add a file named `config.toml` with the following content:

```toml
[server]
enableXsrfProtection = false
enableCORS = false
```

### 6. (Optional) Set Up Password Protection

Optional password protection to restrict access.

**Enable Password Protection:**

In the `secrets.toml` file, uncomment and set the `passw` field:

```toml
[passw]
passw = "your-secure-password"
```

Uncomment lines 51 <-> 55:

```python
PASS = st.secrets["passw"]
password = st.sidebar.text_input("Password", type="password")

if PASS != password:
    st.stop()
```

## Running the App

After completing the installation and configuration steps, you can run the Streamlit app using the following command:

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

Replace `main.py` with the filename of your Streamlit application if different.

The app should open in your default web browser. If it doesn't, navigate to the URL provided in the terminal output (usually `http://localhost:8501`).
